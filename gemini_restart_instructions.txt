# Gemini CLI Session Restart Instructions

To seamlessly resume our session, please follow these steps:

1.  **Start the Gemini CLI:**
    Open your terminal and launch the Gemini CLI.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Once the CLI is running, navigate to our working directory using the `cd` command:
    ```bash
    cd /mnt/CEPH_PROJECTS/WALDSCHAEDEN/temp/setup_fordead_copy_docs
    ```
    Confirm you are in the correct directory by listing its contents (optional):
    ```bash
    ls -F
    ```

3.  **Paste the Session Resume Message:**
    Copy and paste the *entire* block below into the Gemini CLI prompt. This message provides me with the necessary context to pick up exactly where we left off.

--- BEGIN SESSION RESUME MESSAGE ---

Hello! Let's continue our previous session.

Here's a summary of our progress:
- A Git repository has been initialized in `/mnt/CEPH_PROJECTS/WALDSCHAEDEN/temp/setup_fordead_copy_docs/` and an initial commit has been made.
- Standard headers have been added to all R scripts in the main pipeline (`00_RUN_Province_Damage_Update.R` through `06_Integrate_And_Refine_Damage_Products.R`).
- `00_RUN_Province_Damage_Update.R` and `01_Import_S2_data.R` are fully commented.
- We are currently in the process of commenting `02_Execute_Core_FORDEAD_Processing.R`.

Our next step is to continue adding comments to `02_Execute_Core_FORDEAD_Processing.R`.
Specifically, we need to add a comment to the line:
`# if the folder exists, rename masks according to the version id (save a flag)`
(This line is currently at line 200 in the file).

I am ready to propose the next comment for this line, ensuring I read the file's current content immediately before proposing the change, and that the change is granular (one line/small block at a time).

--- END SESSION RESUME MESSAGE ---

**Important Reminders for Commenting:**
- I will propose comments one by one.
- I will always re-read the file to get the exact current content before proposing any change.
- I will clearly state what I intend to replace and with what, so you can verify my understanding.
- Your approval is required for each change.
- If I identify any redundant or potentially incorrect code, I will flag it with a special comment (e.g., `# TODO: Review for redundancy/correctness`) but leave the code itself untouched.
